## Rant on Modern Programming

After checking various resources, I've come to the conclusion that programming, reverse engineering, & cybersecurity are subjects that are too technical and time consuming to be written & shared within a commercial product as simplistic as a book. There are too many variables that could lead to misinformation. It's that or it's all over the place. Some of the best resources I've found were free, be they books, videos, or even the occasional post on some obscure forum that had a unique answer to my problem that no one else could figure out how to solve. Why is it that the best answers are hidden off in some corner of the internet? This information should be public and easy to digest, why isn't it? Why is it that after so many harsh years of trials and tribulations, professional and hobbyists programmers struggle to solve their own problems, such as installing Linux?

Yes, free or rather 'open source' books and resources are the best due to the passion of the authors intent in their readiness of distributing that knowledge. Paid content is usually a one and done case, proceeded by the next book or sponsor in the chain... more importantly tech books are useless anyway. Ironically, even though the OP of this repo is the type of person that would acquire any book with the word 'modern' in the title, as soon as that info is released, it's no longer relevant, and the latest technology comes out or is in beta. Most of you have books you can no longer use due to the tech gaps jumping every few years. So how do we escape this 'problem'? This endless sea, this despair we call ever changing technology? We simply abandon whatever new tools arise or become defunct, and stick with what works, until it doesn't.

I was tired of finding 10+ year old rhetoric that has already changed or will change. However, some of these old books were future proofed by genius authors... perhaps they had the ability to see into the future. Topics like AI have hardly changed, a lot of old school techniques are probably even more effective now than when they were first discovered. Try playing the original F.E.A.R. That game has pretty good AI and is a challenge even on normal difficulty. Much harder than any modern title released today, what with lazy AI, glitches, and pigeon holed programming. 

Try to use any fresh resource you get within the same year you get it, if not, within 2 years. Beyond that, if the data is no longer relevant, if it can be improved, that is also something you can do. Several times over, have I discovered that, in my search for quality tutorials and info, these 'prestigious' books were filled with redundant code/architecture which wouldn't even compile. Do not waste your money with outsourced, non-debugged commercial products written by so-called 'experts' of these languages.

An alternative to looking for outdated resources, whether free or otherwise, is to simply frequent blogs and forum posts along with watching the occasional video. You may not learn as much or as quickly had you
simply picked up a book. But if you aren't reading, then you're probably coding or doing something else anyway. And if you aren't coding, then what are you here for? This project is for coders, go on.

Most of Windows & Linux API is in C.
C++ was the defacto language for projects.
Companies are now shifting toward Rust, Go, etc

Google is attempting to supercede C++ with Carbon.

Rust is popular amongst programmers, but still not 
prevalent in business, despite recent implementation.

Binary = Assembly > C, C++ etc > Javascript etc > Python > Java(sucks).
Learn C, x86, Rust, Go, & Python
